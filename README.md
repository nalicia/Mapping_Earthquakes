# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview 
This week I had the oppurtunity assist Basil and Sadhana in creating interactive maps that show earthquake data from around the world. For this challenege they specifically wnated the data in relation to techtonic plates and the magnitude of the earthquakes. 

Using GeoJSON, Leaflet, Javascript, and VS code I was able to make their requests a reality.
